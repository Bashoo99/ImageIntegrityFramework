# ImageIntegrityFramework
This work aims to contribute to execute several algorithms about Image Integrity, i.e. to verify if an image has been alter in some way or if it is equal to the output of the camera. The software is made to execute more JAR Runnable File executing one only program. The algorithms give in input must respect an interface to deal with framework and being execute from it. To try our software we use an algorithm, DQ Detect. It has been modified to dealing with our goal, and we have considered two dataset for the images, the CASIA TIDE public dataset, de facto standard for the experimental evaluation of image integrity algorithms and an alternative dataset called UniSa TIDE. The size of those dataset are very consistent, so we chose to test our framework using the MapReduce approach through Hadoop framework.
